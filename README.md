## Hi there, I'm Dawid. Nice having you here. 👋

### 🔭 I’m currently working as an IT Technician and aim at making a transition into Cloud Development, focusing on Azure primarily.
&nbsp;  
### 📝 With MS-900 and SC-900 certifications behind me, the aim is now set on AZ-900.  
&nbsp;  
### Meanwhile I also occupy myself with home-lab projects that still my curiosity for technology. I enjoy doing projects with tools like Azure, Terraform, Bash, Automation scripts, Git/GitHub, Virtualization and more.
&nbsp;  
### 💻 As of now I focus on finishing my [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://github.com/madebydawid/azure-resume) and some [Azure Monitoring Projects](https://github.com/madebydawid/azure-monitoring-projects).
