## Hi there, I'm Dawid. Nice having you here. 👋

### 🔭 I’m currently working in IT as an IT Technician and aim at making a transition into Cloud Development, focusing on Azure primarily.
&nbsp;  
### 📝 With MS-900 and SC-900 certificaations behind me, the aim is now set on AZ-900. 
&nbsp;  
### Meanwhile I also occupy myself with home-lab projects mainly using Azure and at times Terraform.
&nbsp;  
### 💻 Working on my Cloud Resume Challenge and some Azure automation projects.
